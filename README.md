# BCA Sea Eagle Distortion

A multi-stage distortion pedal designed in conjunction with Nick Earle. The inspiration was a tight, heavy, Fall out boy-style rhythm tone. It features a dual-gang gain pot, an active 3-band EQ, and several pre-gain tone shaping switches. It is powered by our standard +-15V power supply, and uses a series of current sources to bias the various JFET stages.

## v1.0.0-build
1590BB enclosure with pots for Gain, Bass, Middle, Treble, Volume, and switches for bright, tight/fat, and high/low input gain.
